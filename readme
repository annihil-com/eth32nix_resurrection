*Credits for this release:

 -ELITE_x
 -rabbit
 -LeAkeR

-Fixed Gentity ESP colors.
-Fixed a bug with atkValidate + aim on fire where it'd keep shooting even if the target was dead/not visible.
-Added timenudge & snaps unlocker (they can now be used in any server with any value, even on ETPro - Can be turned on/off)
-Improved random etpro guid, jaymac and unban command (They're randomly generated on the fly now instead of picked from the files)
-Improved chams menu and customization (2 Custom shaders (normal and outline) for Players, weapons and items, each with custom color and toggleable wallhack)
-Changed etproOs cvar to spoofOs and added it to the menu (Now true = win32 and false = linux)
-Fixed aimpoints size for contour trace and number of head and body points are now auto (Aimbot should be a bit better against hiders)
-Fixed muzzlePoint for other mods (Aim should be a LOT better now at different heights in non etpub servers)
-Improved sequential spree sounds (Spree sounds will keep playing if current spree is > 35 and each 5 kills)
-Fixed Aimbot.Respawn() not being called in jaymod.
-Raised frequency from 127 to 230 in CSyscall.S_StartLocalSound (Louder hitsounds and spreesounds)
-Improved ping based prediction for targets (BOTs are not selected through the ClientWindow anymore, the predict adjusts auto as always)
-Anti team kill is not based on the ClientWindow anymore.
-Replaced wickedsick.wav sound with a better quality one.
-Improved auto Z vecs.
-Fixed a bug with distance based size for Class ESP
-Added auto file complaint when someone TKs you (Can be turned on/off)
-Updated client dll code with the latest etpub.
-Added bounding box ESP (Custom border size and opacity, color is the same as Class ESP)
-Improved aimpoints visualization and they're PBSS proof now. 
-More sophisticated hitbox tracing with different aimpoints for head and body + 2 new traces (Static and X Trace, last one is rsHook based and very CPU hungry)
-Moved Color Picker to a new section, increased its size and added custom colors for:
 -Missiles ESP (Grenades, etc.)
 -GUI Texts (Opacity customizable through cvars)
 -HUD Bars (Health, stamina, charge, overheat and reload bars. Opacity customizable through cvars)
-Having enabled autovote won't cancel your own votes anymore.
-Chams can now be customized separately for Team and Enemy players.

-Added randomized aim for Human mode (Customizable randomness and frequency)
-Added preliminary offsets for NQ 1.2.0 (Is NOT meant to be used since it crashes)
-New main screen background image.
-New Class and Weapon icon images (You can choose between old and new icons, requires a vid_restart)
-Improved hit indicator, 3 different styles:
 -Show only damage taken
 -Show only arrow
 -Show damage taken and arrow
-Customizable cvar prefix (Example: eth_set cvarprefix "sal_set". Requires the game to be restarted)
-Fixed a bug where having enabled riflebot wouldn't enable it for real unless you enabled grenade bot.
-The hack will now run on 2.60b if compiled with GCC >= 4.4.0. The only drawback is that you need to put your pk3 file in ~/.etwolf/etmain from now on, it'll work exactly the same way.

*Code cleanup:
-Cleaned up unused code in Sounds.
